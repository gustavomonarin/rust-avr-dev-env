# rust-avr-dev-env

Rust has potential to make arduino development even more interesting.

Although avr support is right on the corner, currently is quite a bit of work to have a rustc with avr support. 

This is a basic docker image including a build of latest https://github.com/avr-rust/ arduino|llvm fork.

# Usage

docker pull gustavomonarin/rust-avr-dev-env
 ...
 
 
# TODO
* Multi stage build
* cleaner images
* samples / usage
